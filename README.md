# About GW2's TOS
As using AutoHotKey to automatically play songs is permitted and as this tool does pretty much the same thing (it's even less macro-y than in the AHK case), there shouldn't be any problem using it.

However, I don't control ANET's banwaves and the "zero risk" cannot be guaranteed.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Usage
1. Connect your physical instrument to the PC.
2. Install the python module `rtmidi`:
```
pip install rtmidi
```
3. Run the script corresponding to your instrument.

# Known issues
Octave switching can be inconsistent.

Doing a 2+ octaves jump in a single note doesn't work.
